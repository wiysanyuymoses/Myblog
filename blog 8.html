                Capsule Wardrobe, what is it and how does it help
                 you at being Minimal on budget yet still fashionable in looks?
            </h2>


            <p class="text">
                A Capsule wardrobe; let’s break it down. You know of a capsule; you know a small drug that contains some chemical in powder form to cure you of an illness, the covering is smooth and shiny and if you open it, which I did, it actually contains what does the “Getting you back to health work”.
            </p>



            <p class="text">
                A Wardrobe;  a furniture made of mostly wood, but now you can get affordable wardrobes made of poles and strong textile to hold your clothing and yet is lighter than the traditional wooden wardrobe.
            </p>


            <p class="text">
                So a Capsule Wardrobe is a collection of clothing items mostly between 20-50 pieces. Now understand me these include tops, trousers, skirts, shoes, and dresses. 
            </p>


            <p class="text">
                Now, lets imagine this: you have got 6 shirts, (2 t-shirts and 4 office shirts), 2 denim trousers(Jeans), I will advise black and blue, 4 office trousers black, dark blue, brown and ash, if you like white you can exchange it for any of the colors I listed or add it, now the footwear: I will advise you to get 3 sport shoes or sneakers and 3 office shoes so you count that and you have got literally a wardrobe on the go of 18 pieces, it’s not even 20. And remember, you can always wear office tops with denim trousers, slap a sneaker on it and you are looking hot for the ladies.
            </p>


            <p class="text">
                Wait-lets not forget a jacket or/and a coat for the cold and yes that’s 20 pieces, my bad. The main aim is to keep it simple and fashionable without stress.
            </p>


            <p class="text">
                Before we continue this breakdown, ACCESSORIES!!! Yes and indeed, I am talking watches, belts, glasses, bags, and the rest, but let’s start with these; I advise 3 belts, 2 to 3 watches, 2-3 glasses, and a nice looking office or casual bag, and Boom! My man can enter any event with confidence and strike a conversation with the ladies, or have high self esteem when chatting with friends or colleagues and even having high stake business meetings with ease and confidence in your attire.
            </p>

                <h3>THE LADIES</h3>
            <p class="text">
                This one is going to be tricky but lets strike it, ladies may I advise you, your secret weapon is something you know already-matching- yes, you heard that  but your decisions should be made when buying your clothing and not in front of the wardrobe. Lets admit; society puts heavy pressure on the ladies to look stylish and classy… so lets dive right in.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Office fashion</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Office settings can be a silent (but loud) battle for ladies and not having fashionable or expensive wears or not having the budget to finance that bitter fashion war with your colleagues, or your friend group in the office can be frustrating at time.
            </p>


            <h4>Strategy 1:</h4>
            <p class="text">
                
                Black and white are the two universal colors that can literally go with anything. Plus, having monochrome colors gives one a neutral but elegant look. That is what we’re aiming for, right? Black trousers, button up tops, pencil skirts, blazers, dresses, gowns, office jackets… You name it. When choosing office wear, I prefer the “smart” look, kinda giving boss vibes but still maintaining simplicity. You’re free to add red, blue, green, yellow; if you want a pop of color to your wardrobe as well. You wouldn’t want to go to work dressed like Darth Varder, now would you? The bottom line is: the backbone of your fashion skeleton which is black, dark blue, white, are colors that are your super power in leveling the playing field, between you and your opponent trying to steal your man (or a guy you really like but haven’t talked to yet. Yes, had a friend, in that situation), or make you feel any less of yourself, and thus your variety of office tops make you look confident and give out that “Boss Lady” aura, trust me, the next time you encounter your office crush, he’ll wonder why he never noticed you before (wink).
            </p>


            <h4>Strategy 2:</h4>
            <p class="text">
                
                FOOT WEARS!!!!  I cannot overemphasize this; you can look good from head to toe but giiiirrl… If your shoes looks like you survived World War One- that’s a huge NO. Your shoes speak volumes of your personality. According to research, the one thing that someone notices when meeting for the first time is your footwear. So yeah, shoes are important. It can make or break your aura or style. Let’s be real, having the right outfit, hairdo or perfume- yes, smell nice too- with the wrong footwear is soooo not stylish. You’ve got to do it right. Now, I’m someone that’ll choose sneakers over heels anytime, any day. But since it’s for work, I’ll suggest pumps, loafers, flats, sandals, wedge heels or even tennis shoes (if you’re feeling sporty). Beauty comes from within. Once you’re beautiful on the inside, it will radiate on the outside and will make you look gorgeous. 
            </p>

            <h4>Strategy 3:</h4>
            <p class="text">
                
                Accessories, my girl you have GOT to match those looks with the right accessories. I don’t mean you should break your bank on a Louis V handbag, no. Minimalist jewelry, glasses, watches, scarves, handbags…  Your call. You’re going to work, not a dinner party. You’ve got to look the look. Corporate ‘fit down to a T. it’s not what you have but how you use it that matters.
            </p>



            <h2>2. Casual Fashion</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Now that we are done with the office, lets come home and settle those disputes you have with your casual wears, I mean how you look when at home, of course but also on your outings, hang out with friends or in a casual gathering with the man you are eyeing to notice that you are not a workaholic but you also know your way being chill, relax and casual in not so formal wears.

            <h2>A. Nigerian Recommendation:  </h2>
            <p class="text">
                - Lattafa yara Eau de Parfum
                - Ophylia EDP
                - Ard Al Zaafaran Mousuf Wardi EDP
                - Alrehab French Coffee EDP
                -  Check Jumia, Konga, Temu or your dealers in the local open markets.
                (I advise jumia, konga, and Temu cause you can find perfumes for 4000 to 6000 Naira nice for a budget just know that delivery fees apply like 1000 – 2000 Naira per item, I will give the links to these online stores)
                </p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts   </h2>
            <p class="text">
                I finally realize that female fashion makes more money for companies than male fashion, and that advising a woman on fashion looks, is another Degree program on its own, I should be a Fashion consultant, even I will start, wait I am, do not worry Wiysanyuy Moses got you covered, see you in the next post and do not forget to check the links for your fashion picks or purchases remember “your selections are done on purchase and not in front of the wardrobe”  Goodbye for now.

                Any veteran of our beloved clash of clans will
                 know that the old days of clash of clans, OK
                  I will use COC cause it’s easier, back to
                   where I stopped, ahh the old days of coc
                    when dark elixir was more important than
                     town hall and upgrading your heroes was
                      an infinite quest cause of the length 
                      in time to wait, OK, not all of us but
                       for the veterans like me that where
                        broke (we need to have a meeting after
                         this) it was like having…., it was like being defenseless.
